# The code below makes Picobot travel to the northern tip of the map.
# If there's nothing around, especially if there's nothing north, move north, back to state 0
0 x*** -> N 0

# If it hits the northeastern wall, go west, back to state 0
0 NExx -> W 0

# If it hits the northwestern wall, go east, back to state 0
0 NxWx -> E 0

# If it's surrounded by north, east, and west walls, go south, and go to state 1
0 NEWx -> S 1

# The code below makes Picobot cover the spaces row by row.
# If at any point it hits the north, east, and southern walls, and there's nothing west, go west, back to state 1
1 **x* -> W 1

# If it hits the west wall, make it go east, go to state 2
1 **W* -> E 2

# If at any point it hits the north, west, and southern walls, and there's nothing east, go east, back to state 2
2 *x** -> E 2

# If it hits the east wall, make it go west, go to state 3
2 *E** -> W 3

# If at any point it hits the north, east, or west walls, go south, go to state 1
